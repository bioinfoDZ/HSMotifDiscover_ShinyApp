combination 1.  (To discover motif in HS sequences)

> HS file : "Ex_simulated_HSseqs_new_M1c_and_M3c_S100E.txt", Motif Length: 7, sequence charcter file: "Chars.txt" , Sequence Weight file: "motif1c_Weight.txt" 

  1. 'Ex_simulated_HSseqs_new_M1c_and_M3c_S100E.txt' ahve two motifs i.e., M1c and M3c.
  2. 'motif1c_Weight.txt' have higher weights for sequences with motif M1c


Combination 2: (SRF motif in DNA sequences )

> HS file : "SRF_syntheticSeqFile_Test.txt",  motif range: 10 , if_revCompStrand=TRUE
